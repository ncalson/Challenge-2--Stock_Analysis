    2018 was not a good year for the stock market as the majority of the results were negative (highlighted in red). The two stocks that remained positive were ENPH and RUN (highlighted in green).

Summary: 
        One advantage is that by refactoring code, you save time from having to repeat writing your code. Refactoring your code also makes it run more efficiently. A disadvantage of refactoring code is if you skip testing larger codes it's very plausible that your code may have bugs.
